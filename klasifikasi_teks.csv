Liverpool held off a late charge from Tottenham after Mohamed Salah struck twice to win 2-1 in north London and lift themselves back into the Premier League top-four race. Jurgen Klopp side had suffered shock defeats to relegation-threatened pair Nottingham Forest and Leeds in their last two league outings but started fast against Spurs, with a sharp touch and finish into the bottom corner from in-form Salah giving them the lead on 11 minutes. Ivan Perisic had a header deflected onto the post by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson and Ryan Sessegnon saw a penalty shout from a challenge by Trent Alexander-Arnold waved away as Spurs came to life - but the Reds struck again just before the break thanks to a gift from Eric Dier. The centre-back miscued a header towards his own goal and Salah (40) raced through to chip in his ninth goal in eight games. Tottenham were sent out early for the second half and - not for the first time this season - were better after the break, with Alisson again pushing a Perisic effort onto the woodwork before Harry Kane (70) fired home a brilliant strike when played in by sub Dejan Kulusevski. Rodrigo Bentancur went close with a couple of headers and Kane glanced wide as Spurs desperately sought another late goal but Liverpool clung on for their first away win in the Premier League this season to move up to eighth and within seven points of fourth-placed Spurs, with a game in hand.;0

According to Fidelity's Financial Resolutions survey, saving more money was the number one-resolution for respondents. Close to half (43%) said this was a goal they wanted to work toward in the new year. Building a nest egg can help you pay for big ticket items — like a house, a vacation, a wedding or even just an expensive item you really want — without taking on additional debt. Having savings can also come in handy if an emergency expense comes up. If you're looking to increase your savings in the new year, it helps to start small — even if you're only transferring $10 a week into your savings account. Starting small helps you build a muscle for saving. This way, when you receive salary bumps, bonuses and gift money, you've already gotten into the habit of saving, and you'll be more likely to transfer that money to your savings account. You may also want to consider automating that process instead of just manually moving money into your savings. Relying on manual transfers leaves a lot of room for procrastination — and before we know it, we've spent the money we intended to save. But when you set up automatic transfers into your savings account, you take away the need to make that decision altogether. You can usually schedule automatic transfers through your bank's mobile app. Lastly, if you want to see your savings grow just a little faster, you can opt for a high-yield savings account instead of a traditional savings account. High-yield savings accounts — like the Marcus by Goldman Sachs Online Savings Account or the Ally Online Savings Account — pay you more in interest each month compared to traditional savings accounts.;2

Wade, bans nearly all abortions, triggering concerns about patient care and hospital obligations under EMTALA. Liberal justices questioned Idaho's stance on emergency abortions and its impact on patients' health.
