@Wilko11,It's already looking likely Australia will miss the next world cup. Losing at home against Bahrain in front of a capacity crowd was inexcusable. And a draw against Indonesia with 16 corner kicks without being able to score is ridiculous. Bahrain just played their next game at home against Japan and were thrashed 0 - 5. With Australia playing Japan in Tokyo next month their campaign is already in deep trouble.,22,2024-09-10T18:51:38Z

@alquranchannel96,"According to the Bible, Jesus is not God, in the Bible there are criteria for God and in the Bible, Jesus does not meet the criteria for being God

1. No one has ever seen God (1 John 4:12) whereas no one has seen Jesus 
2. God is not human (Numbers 23: 19, Hosea 11:9) while Jesus is human (Acts of the Apostles 2:22) 
3. God did not die (1 Timothy 1:17) while Jesus died (1 Corinthians 15: 3-4) 
4. God does not need a savior (Luke 1:37) while Jesus needs a savior (John 4:6-9) 
5. God is not weary (Isaiah 40:28) while Jesus was weary (John 4:6) 
6. God does not sleep (Psalm 121:2-5) while Jesus sleeps (Mark 4:38)

According to the Bible, Jesus was only a prophet based on 3 testimonies 

1. Testimony of people who lived at the same time as Jesus that Jesus was a prophet 
  # Matthew 21: 10-11 >> all the people who were contemporaries of Jesus called him the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee, descendant of David 
  # Mark 14:65 >> Jesus' enemies (Jewish high priests) who wanted Jesus to be executed said he was a prophet, 
  # Luke 24 : 18-19-20 >> After 3 days of the crucifixion, a stranger asked people who were contemporaries of Jesus, about the condition of Jesus, why he was on the cross, then one of the people who were contemporaries of Jesus, his name was Cleopas, said Jesus was a prophet but the Jewish high priests handed Jesus over to be executed 
  # John 7:40 >> Many people who were contemporaries of Jesus said he was a prophet 

2. Jesus' own testimony: Jesus was only a prophet 
  # Matthew 13:34-35 >> Jesus said he was a prophet who explained people who would enter the kingdom of heaven with parables, without parables they would not understand about the kingdom of heaven 
  # Mark 6:4, Luke 4:24, John 4:44 >> Jesus said that he was a prophet who was respected everywhere except in his native place 
  # Mark 12:29 >> Jesus told the Israelites the main law is to worship Allah alone, the Lord of us all, God is One/One 

3. Testimony of the Holy Spirit/Gabriel/Gabriel
  # Samuel 15:29 >> God is not human 
  # Deuteronomy 4:35,39, Deuteronomy 6:4 >> He is Allah, there is no god but Him, the only God

10 reasons Jesus is not God but Jesus is only a prophet/apostle just like Abraham/Ibrahim, Moses/Moses and Muhammad, according to the Bible 

1. In John 17:3 Jesus said there is no god but Allah and Jesus Christ is only the messenger/prophet/apostle of Allah 
2. If Jesus is God, God is all-knowing of everything (Isaiah 46:9-10) but in Matthew 24:36 and Mark 13:32 Jesus does not know when the day will end, because Jesus does not know when the day will end, then Jesus does not know everything, because Jesus does not know everything then Jesus is not God 
3. In Matthew 7: 21-23 it is stated that everyone who thinks Jesus is God will not enter heaven, in the last days Jesus will not recognize and expel people who think Jesus is God 
4. In John 16:25-26, on the last day, Jesus tells us who the Father/God really is, frankly, that prayer should only be to the Father/God, not Jesus, the person who prays to Jesus, Jesus will not ask the Father for salvation for that person, because the one who loves humans is the Father/God, not Jesus, Jesus only comes from the Father and returns to The Father is the same as the prophets and other humans. 
5. In Isaiah 29: 12 prophesies that the revelation/word of God will one day be given to a person who when asked to read, he answered I can't read and that's Muhammad because in the history of Muhammad's life all the writers report that, when he received revelation in the cave of Hira he told to read by the angel Gabriel/Gabriel ""read"" he said I can't read and the first revelation revealed was ""iqra"" read
6. In Song of Solomon 5:16, it tells a prophecy about the prophet Muhammad, that the future lover of the prophet Solomon/Sulaiman, the name Muhammad, is written there in the original Hebrew language which, if pronounced, reads ""mahamadim"" the prefix im means respect for the name because of its value. attached to the name (everything about him is attractive, his words are sweet, etc.) 
7. In John 16:12-16 Jesus said that I still have a lot to say to you but later there will be a spirit of truth (the angel Gabriel/Jibril) who will come to a messenger/prophet after me who will lead in the truth, who will say no according to him but according to the revelation/word of God, who announces to you things that will come (apocalypse, life after death, etc.), which he will glorify me, that is Muhammad, Muhammad glorified Jesus as a prophet, glorified Mother Mary, the mother of Jesus, Muhammad conveyed news about things the future (apocalypse, life after death) in the Koran, Muhammad comes after Jesus. 
8. In the historical writings about Paul, Paul was a person full of hypocrisy, he killed Jesus' obedient disciple (Stephen) and helped King Herod (the Roman-Jewish king) to kill the other disciples of Jesus until they were finished, he only pretended to repent with confession. himself by saying he had met Jesus, to change the gospel with his own hands, (Provenly Paul's letter -14 letters- dominates the New Testament Bible -27 letters-) while his name is not in the 12 disciples of Jesus or the 70 disciples of Jesus
9. There are differences between the teachings of Paul and Jesus, differentiate between the teachings of Paul and Jesus and you will find Islam 
  1) Jesus said don't think that my coming will abolish the law, no! I just fulfilled it (Matthew 5:17-20), but Paul said the coming of Jesus abolished the law (Galatians 2:16), 
  2) Jesus ordered circumcision (Luke 2:21), but Paul forbade circumcision (Galatians 5:6 / 1 Corinthians 7:19) 
  3) Jesus forbade eating unclean meat/swine (pork) (Leviticus 11:7-8), (Isaiah 65:4), (Deuteronomy 14:8) and strong drinks (Isaiah 5:22) but Paul made pork permissible (Romans 14:17) and strong drink (1 Timothy 5:23) 
  4) Jesus never said he was God but only a prophet (John 13:16), but Paul considered Jesus to be God (1 Corinthians 8:6) 
  5) Jesus forgave the 2 people who were crucified (Luke 23:32-38), but Paul cursed the 2 people on the cross (Galatians 3:13) 
  6) Jesus taught that there are no inheritance sins, children are pure from sin (Mark 10:13-16) while Paul taught inheritance sins (Romans 5:12-21) 
  7) Jesus said the sins were borne by himself (Matthew 16:27) while Paul said the sins were borne by Jesus (Colossians 1:13-14) 
10. In the book of Deuteronomy 6 verse 4 God is Ehad/Ahad/Esa (one) not a unity or trinity",0,2024-09-10T15:39:15Z
